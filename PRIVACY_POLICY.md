## We Do Not Collect Your Data

This extension operates entirely on your local device. All settings and configurations are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage system.

## Local Storage Only

Your extension settings (URLs, timers, passwords) are saved only on your device using Chrome's secure storage. If you use Chrome Sync, these settings may sync across your own browsers, but this is handled entirely by Google Chrome, not by our extension.
